            <h3>What are the future plans for Edis?</h3>
            <p>
            We're thinking about clustering support differently than Redis. We care more about allowing reads and writes from any node, and less about the consistency of answers. That puts our natural inclination toward (at least for our current uses) the "A" and "P" of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem">CAP</a>, supporting reads and writes from any node, even if the nodes can't talk to each other, and ignoring conflicts. This is the opposite of how Redis works, in that if you request from a slave and it is not in sync, it may return an error, and further, you can only write to the master server. So, we're thinking about clustering in that sense but we haven't implemented anything yet. Our #1 goal was better persistence for Redis, and we believe we're already at that point though the project is in a very early stage, but clustering support was always on the list as the next goal.
